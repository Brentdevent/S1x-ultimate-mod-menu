# S1x ultimate mod menu
A zombie and multiplayer mod menu for S1x. It's rather limited for now due string overflow errors. Mod menu will be improved once I'm able to fix this issue.

Also Survival will be a thing for the future.

## Features
- Infinite ammo
- Godmode
- Higher jumps for exo suits
- Wallhack
- Spawn killstreaks
- Spawn various hidden weapons

## How to install
place the lua files in a folder in `<Game Directory Name>\s1x\scripts`
